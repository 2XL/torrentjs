			<p class="definition no-audio ">

				Communications requirements and quality standards are needed before risks (especially risks relating to communications and quality) can be determined (choice A). Iterations (choice B) cannot begin until the risks are identified, qualified, quantified, and responses developed.<br>
				These then create the need to revise the WBS and other parts of the project management plan. <br>

				The project charter is created during the initiating process group. Therefore the question is asking what is done next in either the initiating process group or the planning process group.

There is little risk expected for the project, and the project manager has managed many projects similar to this one. What is the NEXT thing to do?<br>

			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer B<br>
				Look at the order of planning the project the team has chosen. Though understanding the experience of the sponsor (choice A) might sound like a good idea, the sponsor is a stakeholder and understanding the stakeholders is part of stakeholder analysis. That should have occurred before the creation of a WBS. In planning the project, the project scope is defined (choice C is another way of saying finalize the project scope statement) and would come before creating a WBS.<br>
				Choice D cannot be best, as that work does not come next in the process. Other work, like creating a network diagram, should be completed before risk management can effectively be done. The only correct choice is the activity list (choice B).</span>		</p>

High-level assumptions are determined prior to risk identification in the planning process making choice C incorrect. Metrics are part of the quality management plan, making choice D incorrect.

The new project manager is having difficulty finding enough time to manage the project because the product and project scope are being progressively elaborated. The PMP-certified project manager mentions that the basic tools for project management, such as a work breakdown structure, can be used during project executing to assist the project manager. For which of the following can a work breakdown structure be used?<br>
				<br>
				A. Communicating with the customer <br>

				A WBS does not show dates or responsibility assignments (choices Band C). Those are included on the bar chart and possibly in the communications management plan.

				<br>
				Is this a hard question? The whole discussion of the team member and his actions is a distracter. The real problem is not that the team member is being uncooperative. He is asking a question that many team members want to ask in the real world. How can I tell you how things are going if I do not know what work I am being asked to do? The real problem is the lack of a WBS and work packages; otherwise the team member would not have to ask such a question. Choice A cannot be the answer because the project manager is not losing resources (what is implied by getting the manager's buy-in). Though a reward system (choice B) would help with cooperation, the real problem here is not cooperation. Choice C cannot be the answer because it does not solve the problem at hand (the team member not knowing what he is to do). It solves another problem. If you chose C, be very careful! You can get 10 to 20 questions wrong on the exam simply because you do not see the real problem!)</span>		</p>

			<p class="definition no-audio ">

				There are many pieces of data in this question that are distracters from the real issue. Though it is common to have to cut costs (choice A) and add resources to a project (choice D), nothing in the question should lead you to think these will be required in this situation.<br>
				Customers do not generally approve the project scope (what you are going to do to complete their requirements); instead, they approve the product scope (their requirements), so choice B cannot be best. Since the requirements are a measure of the completion of the product of the project (choice C), not having completed requirements makes such measurement impossible.

			<p class="definition no-audio ">
			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer B<br>
				<br>
				Asking percent complete (choice A) is not a best practice since it is usually a guess.<br>
				Often the easiest work is done first on a project, throwing off any percentage calculations of work remaining. It may be a good thing to use the 50/50 rule, as in choice C. However, the 50/50 rule is not necessarily induded in the progress report, and the second part of the sentence is incorrect. The life cyde cost cannot be lower than the project cost, as the life cyde cost indudes the project cost.<br>
				Choice D is often done by inexperienced project managers who know of nothing else. Not only does it provide little information, but also it cannot be used to predict the future. Choice B is the best answer since it looks at the past and uses this information to estimate future costs.</span>		</p>

			<p class="definition no-audio ">

				<br>
				If the costs are more than expected under a fixed price contract, the seller must pay those costs. As explained in the Procurement Management chapter, "cost risk" refers to the person who will have to pay for the added cost if costs escalate. Because the price is fixed, the seller will have to pay any increased costs out of their profit. Naturally, this does not include increased PRICE due to change orders. A fixed price contract and the PRICE could be changed with change orders.</span>		</p>

				<br>
				Actual costs are used to measure CPI, and there is no reason to use SPI in this situation, so choices A and B are not correct. Using past history (choice D) is another way of saying "analogous," The best way to estimate is bottom-up (choice C). Such estimating would have improved the overall quality of the estimate.</span>		</p>

				This is one of those questions that combines topics from various knowledge areas. Did you fall into the trap of calculating the float for Z? The amount of float for one activity and the number of stakeholders does not tell you anything in this case, so choices Band D cannot be the best answers. The CPI is greater than one and the SPI is less than one. Therefore, the thing to be most worried about would be schedule.</span>		</p>

			<p class="definition no-audio ">
			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer C<br>
				<br>
				This question is full of choices that are not correct project management actions. If you picked the wrong answer, look again at the choices and try to determine what you are missing. Whatever it is, it will show up more than once on the real exam!<br>
				To answer the question, you must first realize that it is never appropriate for a project manager to just cut estimates across the board (choice B). The project manager should have created an estimate with realistic work package estimates that do not include padding. Then, if costs must be decreased, the project manager can look to cut quality, decrease risk, cut scape, or use cheaper resources (and at the same time closely monitor the impact of changes on the project schedule).<br>
				One of the worst things a project manager can do is to start a project while knowing that the time or cost for the project is unrealistic. Therefore, choice A cannot be best. Notice that choice D suggests adding resources. That would cost more. Choice C involves evaluating, looking for alternatives, and then going to the sponsor to tell him the impact of the cost cutting.</span>		</p>

				<br>
				Many people would pick choice A. lt is proactive, but choice C mentions root cause and the probable effect of dealing with the problem. If a problem with quality occurs again, some other project constraint(s) must change to accommodate fixing the problem. Choice B is partially correct (allow schedule to slip) but may not need to occur, because the project manager might be able to compress the schedule in other areas. Besides, cutting cost does not necessarily cause the schedule to slip. Choice D is not best, because a quality problem is most likely to create additional cost, rather than cut cost.</span>		</p>

				A. Improved quality leads to increased productivity, increased cost effectiveness, and decreased cost risk<br>
				B. Improved quality leads to increased productivity, decreased cost effectiveness, and increased cost risk<br>

To date, none of the activities/work packages have been on the critical path, nor have they affected the critical chain planning that has occurred. The project manager is bothered by the problem, since four of the next five critical path activities are being completed by this department. After making three calls, the project manager is finally able to converse with the department manager to determine what is going on. The conversation is slow, because both speak different native languages and they are trying to converse in French, a shared language. To make communication easier, the project manager frequently asks the department manager to repeat back what has been said.<br>

It may not be needed on the project, and it does not deal with the problem at hand, the policy that is slowing things down. Choice B is not the best choice as the project manager already has heard the opinion on many other occasions. It is already confirmed. Choice C is just being reactive. A good project manager will find the root cause and deal with that, even if it means attempting to improve the company's policies and processes. This is continuous improvement. Because there are several activities affected by the policy, it would serve the project better to get to the root cause of the problem and solve it.</span>		</p>

			    <span class="qWord lang-en">23. The installation project has a CPI of 1.03 and an SPI of 1.0. There are 14 team members, and each team member had input into the final project management plan. The customer has accepted the three deliverables completed so far without complaint and the responsibility assignment matrix has not changed since the project began. The project is being completed in a matrix environment and there are no contracts needed for the project. Though the sponsor is happy with the status of the project, one of the team members is always complaining about how much time his project work is taking. Which of the following would be the BEST thing for the project manager to do?<br>
				<br>
				A. Review the reward system for the project<br>
				B. Try to improve schedule performance of the project<br>
				C. Meet with the customer to try to extend the schedule<br>
				D. Gain formal acceptance in writing from the customer</span>	</h3>

			<p class="definition no-audio ">
			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer A<br>
				<br>
				Improving schedule performance (choice B) relates to getting the project completed<br>
				sooner. Though it would seem to always be a good idea to improve schedule performance, this project's performance is fine. The schedule has been approved as it is. lt would be better for the project manager to spend more time controlling the project to make sure it finishes according to plan than to improve schedule performance.<br>
				If you chose C, ask yourself why. There is nothing wrong with the schedule performance of the project that would require an extension. Did you think that the best way to deal with the complaining stakeholder was to give hirn more time? How do you know the team member's activities are on the critical path?<br>
				lt is always important to gain formal acceptance from the customer, as it provides an opportunity for the team to check if everything is going well, lt is a good idea to get such acceptance in writing. Choice D could be done, but there is a more important problem that takes precedence here. Read on.<br>
				The only thing glaringly wrong in this situation is that the team member is complaining. If you read the situation completely, you will notice that the team member was involved and approved the project management plan, including his own involvement in the project. Since the responsibility assignment matrix has not changed, the team member has not even been assigned different duties since the project began. There must be something else causing the team member to complain. The project manager should investigate and find out what part of the reward system is ineffective.</span>		</p>

Unfortunately, the tension has grown to the point where team meetings have become shouting matches and little work is accomplished during the meetings. One team member asks to be excused from future team meetings, as all the shouting upsets him. Meanwhile, the sponsor has asked to attend team meetings in order to better understand how the project is going and the issues involved in completing the project, and the customer has started discussions about adding scope to the project. In this situation, it would be BEST for the project manager to:<br>
				<br>
				A. Ask the sponsor if the information needed could be sent in a report rather than have her attend the meeting<br>
				B. Inform the team member who asked to be excused from the meetings of the value of communication in such meetings<br>

				<br>
				Here is a situation where all four choices could be done. Choice A does not solve the root cause of the problem described. Choice B merely dismisses the concerns of the team member and might cause anger. A team-building exercise (choice D) would take planning and so could not be done right away. Remember, the sponsor might be attending the next meeting and at least one team member might not attend because of past problems. The best thing to do would be to set up new ground rules for the team governing behavior (choice C) and then plan a team-building exercise (choice D).</span>		</p>

				Notice the phrasing of this question, "most likely NOT do," Expect to see questions worded on the exam in ways that can cause you to misinterpret them. You will also see questions about things we forget to do in the real world. "Who has time;' you might say, "to determine if each problem is really solved?" One could respond with, "Who has time not to do this? Who has time to deal with the same problem twice?" The final steps of problem solving include: implement a decision, review it, and confirm that the decision solved the problem.</span>		</p>

The project team was co-located into a new building when the project started. Everyone commented on how excited they were to have all new facilities. The sponsor is providing adequate support for the project, and few unidentified risks have occurred. In an attempt to improve performance, the project manager spends part of the project budget on new chairs for the team members and adds the term "senior" to each team member's job title. Which of the following is the MOST correct thing that can be said of this project or the project manager?<br>
				<br>
				A. The project manager has misunderstood Herzberg's theory<br>
				B. The project is slowly spending more money than it should. The project manager should begin to watch cost more carefully<br>

				D. The project manager should use good judgment to determine which variances are important</span>	</h3>

			<p class="definition no-audio ">
			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer A<br>
				<br>
				Choice B includes the concept of cost to trick you into selecting it if you are unsure of the real answer. There is no indication that the costs are trending in any particular direction. There is no reason to think that performance reviews should turn up more adjustments (choice C). The project manager should always use good judgment (choice D), but nothing in this question talks about judgment regarding variances, so this cannot be the best choice, In this situation, the project manager is making great working conditions better. According to Herzberg's theory, fixing bad working conditions will help you to motivate, but making good working conditions better will not improve motivation. You need to focus on the motivating agents and not the hygiene factors</span>		</p>

The project is on schedule to meet an aggressive deadline when the successor activity to a critical path activity suffers a major setback. The activity has 14 days of float and is being completed by four people. There are two other team members with the skill set to assist the troubled activity, if needed.

				D. Create an issue log</span>	</h3>

			<p class="definition no-audio ">
			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer D<br>
				<br>
				Sometimes complex problems are caused by not doing simple things. The data in the first paragraph, once you read the choices, is completely extraneous. The troubled activity has float and so does not need immediate attention. Choice A may not be necessary if the amount of float will not be exceeded by the problem. None of the choices suggest investigating if the amount of float is enough to cover any delay caused by the trouble, whatever it is. Rather, the choices take you in different directions. Choice B should have already been done before the project began. Choice C cannot be best, as replacing team members does not solve the root cause of the problem. Could there be something that the project manager is doing wrong, or could be doing that she is not, that would solve the problem without losing resources? Wouldn't it be more effective to discover the root cause of those team members' concerns so that the problem does not surface again later? The creation of an issue log will let the troubled team members know that their concerns have been heard, are noted, and will be resolved. This might be enough to stop them from leaving and avoid project delays and<br>
				confusion if new team members must be added. This makes choice D the best answer.</span>		</p>

A project manager overhears a conversation between two stakeholders who are talking about how unhappy they are with the impacts of the project on their own departments. Stakeholder A asks if the project is on time, and stakeholder B replies that the SPI is 1.05. Stakeholder A asks if the project manager for the project knows of stake holder B's concern. Stakeholder B responds that he is not sure. What is the BEST thing for the project manager to do?<br>
				<br>
				A. Make sure the stakeholders see that the project manager overheard and then ask them to direct any questions to the project manager in writing<br>
				B. Make a presentation to all the stakeholders regarding the status of the project<br>

			<p class="definition no-audio ">
			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer D<br>
				<br>
				Here again is a question with more than one right answer. Would asking for something in writing be the best way to communicate? In this particular situation, asking for the concern to be in writing might alienate the stakeholders. Therefore, choice A cannot be best. The issue log (choice C) is where the issue should be listed, but the situation does not say if the project manager knows what the stakeholder's concern is. Therefore, C cannot be the best choice. Why not choice B? Notice the use of the words "all stakeholders" Why bother other stakeholders with this problem when the project manager already knows there may be some concern of stakeholders A and B to address, not all stakeholders. Choice B refers to making a presentation. Presentations are formal verbal. This problem would likely require informal verbal communication in order to discover the real problem. Choice D is therefore the best choice.</span>		</p>

The work authorization system has allowed people to know when to start work, and the issue log has helped keep track of stakeholders' needs. The benefit cost ratio has been improving, and the sponsor has expressed his appreciation for the team members' efforts by hosting a milestone party for the team.

				<br>
				A. The project manager was focusing on the sponsor's needs<br>
				B. Functional management was not included in the communications management plan<br>

			<p class="definition no-audio ">
			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer B<br>
				<br>
				Since there is no information about the sponsor or his needs in this situation and nothing presented here relates to sponsors, choice A cannot be best. Choice C cannot be best, as it is not a correct statement. One watches both predecessor and successor activities. Choice D cannot be best, as the attendance at the party and the issue at hand are not related. Often forgotten in communications management plans are the bosses of team members (functional management, since of course you remember that we are assuming a matrix organization). Including the bosses of team members in communications planning, requirements gathering, risk management, and other areas of project <br>
				management helps make the project better. In addition, it helps the boss manage his own resources effectively. If the functional manager of the team member assigned to the predecessor activity had been included, he would have known when the team member was needed to do work for the project and the impact, if any, of delay. The communications management plan might also have included a method to communicate potential delays. For these reasons, choice B is best.</span>		</p>

Because the project is 20 percent complete to date and the team has had successful performance reports from five of the affected departmnents, the project manager holds a party to celebrate. The project manager invites key stakeholders from all of the departments to the party, in order to give those providing good reviews an informal opportunity to communicate good things to those departments that have not yet been affected by the project. At the party, the project manager walks around to try to discover any relevant information that would help the project be more successful. He happens to hear a manager of one of the departments talking about setting up more regular meetings on the project. The BEST thing for the project manager to do would be to FIRST:<br>
				<br>
				A. Record the effectiveness of the party in the project lessons learned<br>
				B. Review the information distribution methods on the project<br>
				C. Hold a meeting of all the stakeholders to discuss their concerns<br>
				D. Make sure the manager has a copy of the communications management plan so he is reminded that such concerns should be sent to the project manager</span>	</h3>

			<p class="definition no-audio ">
			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer B<br>
				<br>
				Many of these choices could be done, but ask yourself, "What is the most effective thing to do?" The party may well generate lessons learned, and recording them (choice A) would certainly be a good idea, but the question asked what to do first. There is a more immediate issue the manager. Choice C could also be useful, but it would require taking time of all the stakeholders when there is only one stakeholder, the manager, who definitely has an issue. Besides, a good project manager would be holding regular meetings with the stakeholders already. Choice D might be a good idea, as the manager apparently is not communicating with the project manager. However, this would not absolutely make sure the manager does communicate. <br>
				The manager is, in effect, saying that he is not getting the information he needs. His lack of needed information is causing hirn to suggest more meetings. Too many meetings are a problem on projects. The concept of information distribution (choice B) is to determine who needs what information and plan how to get it to them. A great project manager does not just add meetings, but solves the real problem in the best way. That might take the form of changing a report or sending existing reports to different people rather than adding meetings. For these reasons, choice B is best.</span>		</p>

				B. Make sure the change control process is not used as a vehicle to add the requirements back into the project<br>

				Why would choice D be the action not to take? Isn't it similar to choice A? Yes and no. This issue should be over, but since there were so many meetings and arguments about the requirements being removed, it is unlikely that the issue will be dropped by the stakeholders.<br>
				However, since it has not come up again, and the project was started six months ago, spending time in a meeting is excessive. The other choices are easier and have less impact on the project and are therefore things that could be done.</span>		</p>

The team member goes on to explain that he notified the project manager that this would occur during a phone conversation they had while the project manager was traveling.

			<p class="definition no-audio ">
			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer D<br>
				<br>
				The pitch and tone of voice (choice A) is not relevant here, as the project manager could not even hear what was being said. There were no issues recognized after the conversation, so none could be added to the issue log (choice B). This issue is not related to communications requirements, so choice C cannot be best. Saying, "I am not sure I properly heard what you said" during the conversation or asking for the message to be repeated back to the sender would have prevented this problem.

				A change to the project charter is not always necessary. In fact, a change to the charter is a fundamental change to the project and may require a major adjustment to all aspects of the project management plan. There are many reasons the other choices could happen as a result of risk. Since a contract can only be created after risks are known (a contract is a tool to transfer risks), it is common sense that choice A cannot be the exception. The project management plan (choice B) could change to include a modified WBS and new work packages related to mitigating risk. The communications management plan (choice C) could change as a way to address a risk. Choice D is the best answer.</span>		</p>

				To mitigate risk (choice A), we either reduce the probability of the event happening or reduce its impact. Many people think of using insurance as a way of decreasing impact. However, mitigating risk is taking action before a risk event occurs. Buying insurance is not such an action.<br>
				Acceptance of risk (choice C) does not involve such action as purchasing insurance. Avoidance of risk (choice D) means we change the way we will execute the project so the risk is no longer a factor. Transference is passing the risk off to another party.</span>		</p>

Because this project is business-critical and very visible, senior management has told you to analyze the project's risks and prepare response strategies for them as soon as possible. The organization has risk management procedures that are seldom used or followed, and has had a history of handling risks badly. The projects first milestone is in two weeks. In preparing the risk response plan, input from which of the following is generally LEAST important?<br>
				<br>
				A. Project team members<br>
				B. Project sponsor<br>
				C. Individuals responsible for risk management policies and templates<br>
				D. Key stakeholders</span>	</h3>

			<p class="definition no-audio ">
			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer B<br>
				<br>
				Team members (choice A) will have knowledge of the project and the product of the project and will thus have a lot to contribute to risk responses. Those responsible for risk templates (choice C) will be able to provide the templates from past projects (historical records) and therefore will be very important. Key stakeholders (choice D) will know more about the technical working of the project to help plan "What are we going to do about it?" so choice D is not likely to be the least important. The sponsor (choice B) may have the least knowledge of what will work to solve the problems. Sponsors need to be involved in the project and help identify risks. They may even approve the response plans created by others, but they would not generally be major contributors to response plans. This makes B the best choice.</span>		</p>

A hurricane caused power outages just when the upgrade was near completion. When the power was restored, all of the project reports and historical data were lost with no way of retrieving them. What should have been done to prevent this problem?<br>

				A. Purchase insurance<br>

				D. Schedule the installation outside of the hurricane season</span>	</h3>

			<p class="definition no-audio ">
			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer C<br>
				<br>
				The risk is the loss of data due to a power outage. Choice A is not related to "mitigating" the problem. It transfers the risk. A reserve fund (choice B) is acceptance and would help address the cost factors after the power failure, but would not reduce the probability or impact of it. Avoiding the hurricane by scheduling the installation at a different time (choice D) mitigates the power outage risk but could have a large negative impact on the project schedule and so is not the best choice. The better choice of the mitigation options (choices C and D) is to monitor the weather and know when to implement the contingency plan.</span>		</p>

				When a new risk is identified, it should go through the risk management process. Choice A cannot be the best choice, as you first need to determine the probability and impact of the risk and then try to diminish impact through the Plan Risk Responses process. Only after these efforts should you add reserves. Choice C addresses only costs, when there could also be a time impact. This choice also ignores the work of Plan Risk Responses. Choice D cannot be the best choice because it is better to determine reserves based on a detailed analysis of risk. Therefore, the best choice is B.</span>		</p>

				Once signed, a contract is binding. Generally, the inability to perform, get financing, or one party's belief that the contract is null and void does not change the fact that the contract is binding. If, however, both sides agree to terminate the contract, the contract can move into closure. Once closure is completed, the project is considered completed.</span>		</p>

				Often the seller is required to inform the buyer of anything that is missing or unclear in the procurement documents (choice B). It is in the buyer's best interest to discover missing items, since it will save the buyer money and trouble to correct the problem early. Procurement documents must contain terms and conditions and evaluation criteria (choice C), as well as all the work that is to be done, including the procurement statement ofwork (choice D). This is so the seller can price the project and know what is most important to the buyer. Choice A is an important point for the real world and is the best answer.</span>		</p>

Both good scope definition and incentives are required to make it happen. Which provides the better answer? Along with good scope definition, you need the seller to feel your need for speed.

				<br>
				In choice A, the contract could be wrong, or the customer could be wrong, but this would have/should have been discovered earlier if proper project management was followed. If you picked choice B, you have forgotten that a seller cannot issue a change order (although he could request one). Did you select choice D? If so, remember that project management is not about making every decision with ALL the team members. Choke C involves meeting with the appropriate team member. If such a problem has arisen, it could mean something was wrong in the WBS dictionary or in how the team member completed the work.</span>		</p>

				<br>
				A. Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF)<br>
				B. Time &amp; material (T&amp;M)<br>
				C. Fixed price (FP)<br>
				D. Fixed price incentive fee (FPIF)</span>	</h3>

			<p class="definition no-audio ">
			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer A<br>
				<br>
				If you got this question wrong, reread it. You need to audit invoices in all contract types, so how do you choose? Look for the answer that is BEST. In this case, it would be the choice that requires the greatest effort.<br>
				A T&amp;M contract (choice B) should be for small dollars and short duration (remember that a T&amp;M contract has no incentive to finish), so it does not have a great risk. Choices C and D cannot be best because the risk to the buyer is limited-they are still only going to pay the contract price. In a CPFF contract, the buyer pays all costs. The seller could be charging the buyer for costs that should not be allocated to the buyer. Because of the size and dollar amount of these type of contracts and because the risk to the buyer is great, CPFF contracts need the most auditing. Since this question asked for which one you do not want to use, the answer must be choice A.</span>		</p>

One stakeholder wants to add many items to the procurement statement of work. Another stakeholder only wants to describe the functional requirements. The project is important for the project manager's company, but a seller will do the work. How would you advise the project manager?<br>
				<br>
				A. The procurement statement of work should be general to allow the seller to make his own decisions<br>
				B. The procurement statement of work should be general to allow clarification later<br>
				C. The procurement statement of work should be detailed to allow clarification later<br>
				D. The procurement statement of work should be as detailed as necessary for the type of project</span>	</h3>

			<p class="definition has-audio ">
			    <span class="qDef lang-en">Answer D<br>
				<br>
				When the seller has more expertise than the buyer, the procurement statement of work should describe performance or function rather than a complete list of work. In any case, the procurement statement of work should be as detailed as possible.</span>		</p>
